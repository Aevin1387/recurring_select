= RecurringSelect (Alpha)

This is a gem to add a number of selectors and helpers for working with recurring schedules in a rails app. It uses the IceCube recurring scheduling gem (https://github.com/seejohnrun/ice_cube). This is still a work in progress, but feel free to make requests, or even better write some code.
